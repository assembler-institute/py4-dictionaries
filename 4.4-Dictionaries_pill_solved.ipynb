    "We want to create a dictionary that stores this equivalence. Follow these steps:\n",

    "**1)** Extract from the table within this article the information in the first three rows, for bits and qubits, and store it in two lists, one for each:\n",
    "\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**2)** Now that we have all the required information, let us create the dictionary, but this time from two lists that have a correspondence of 1 to 1. The resulting dictionary must have a structure with the keys with the qubits and their equivalence in bits in the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can store the information as you see fit, but it is convenient that if you store the '3' qubits as a string, you do the same with its equivalent in bits, and with the rest of the rows. I.e., '3' : '8' or 3 : 8, but not '3' : 8. Remember that when calling a dictionary item, you have to refer to its key exactly.\n",
